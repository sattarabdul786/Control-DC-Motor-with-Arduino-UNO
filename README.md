# Control-DC-Motor-with-Arduino-UNO
We need to regulate the motor's speed and direction in order to have total control over it. To achieve this, we will utilise the internal H-bridge for controlling the direction of the motor and the Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) technique to control the speed.

#Motor Speed Control - PWM 
When discussing a DC motor, we must adjust the amplitude of the input voltage that is applied to the motor in order to vary the speed of the DC motor. Pulse width modulation, or PWM, is a widely used method for doing such. In PWM, the applied voltage is altered by transmitting a sequence of pulses, resulting in an output voltage that is proportional to the duty cycle (also known as pulse width) produced by the microcontroller.
